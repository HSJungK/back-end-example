# String WebFlux
* [Document](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux)

The original web framework included in the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC, was purpose-built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers. The reactive-stack web framework, Spring WebFlux, was added later in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports Reactive Streams back pressure, and runs on such servers as Netty, Undertow, and Servlet containers.
Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules (spring-webmvc and spring-webflux) and co-exist side by side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional. Applications can use one or the other module or, in some cases, both — for example, Spring MVC controllers with the reactive WebClient.

Why was Spring WebFlux created?

Part of the answer is the need for a non-blocking web stack to handle concurrency with a small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware resources. Servlet non-blocking I/O leads away from the rest of the Servlet API, where contracts are synchronous (Filter, Servlet) or blocking (getParameter, getPart). This was the motivation for a new common API to serve as a foundation across any non-blocking runtime. That is important because of servers (such as Netty) that are well-established in the async, non-blocking space.

The other part of the answer is functional programming. The addition of lambda expressions in Java 8 created opportunities for functional APIs in Java. This is a boon for non-blocking applications and continuation-style APIs (as popularized by CompletableFuture and ReactiveX) that allow declarative composition of asynchronous logic. At the programming-model level, Java 8 enabled Spring WebFlux to offer functional web endpoints alongside annotated controllers.

### [Define “Reactive”](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-why-reactive)
* * *
We touched on “non-blocking” and “functional” but what does reactive mean?

The term, “reactive,” refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change — network components reacting to I/O events, UI controllers reacting to mouse events, and others. In that sense, non-blocking is reactive, because, instead of being blocked, we are now in the mode of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available.

There is also another important mechanism that we on the Spring team associate with “reactive” and that is non-blocking back pressure. In synchronous, imperative code, blocking calls serve as a natural form of back pressure that forces the caller to wait. In non-blocking code, it becomes important to control the rate of events so that a fast producer does not overwhelm its destination.

Reactive Streams is a small spec (also adopted in Java 9) that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure. For example a data repository (acting as Publisher) can produce data that an HTTP server (acting as Subscriber) can then write to the response. The main purpose of Reactive Streams is to let the subscriber control how quickly or how slowly the publisher produces data.

    Common question: what if a publisher cannot slow down?
    The purpose of Reactive Streams is only to establish the mechanism and a boundary. 
    If a publisher cannot slow down, it has to decide whether to buffer, drop, or fail.

### [Reactive API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-reactive-api)
* * *
Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability. It is of interest to libraries and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API, because it is too low-level. Applications need a higher-level and richer, functional API to compose async logic — similar to the Java 8 Stream API but not only for collections. This is the role that reactive libraries play.

Reactor is the reactive library of choice for Spring WebFlux. It provides the Mono and Flux API types to work on data sequences of 0..1 (Mono) and 0..N (Flux) through a rich set of operators aligned with the ReactiveX vocabulary of operators. Reactor is a Reactive Streams library and, therefore, all of its operators support non-blocking back pressure. Reactor has a strong focus on server-side Java. It is developed in close collaboration with Spring.

WebFlux requires Reactor as a core dependency but it is interoperable with other reactive libraries via Reactive Streams. As a general rule, a WebFlux API accepts a plain Publisher as input, adapts it to a Reactor type internally, uses that, and returns either a Flux or a Mono as output. So, you can pass any Publisher as input and you can apply operations on the output, but you need to adapt the output for use with another reactive library. Whenever feasible (for example, annotated controllers), WebFlux adapts transparently to the use of RxJava or another reactive library. See [Reactive Libraries](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-reactive-libraries) for more details.

    In addition to Reactive APIs, 
    WebFlux can also be used with Coroutines APIs 
    in Kotlin which provides a more imperative style of programming.

### [Programming Models](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-programming-models)
* * *

The spring-web module contains the reactive foundation that underlies Spring WebFlux, including HTTP abstractions, Reactive Streams adapters for supported servers, codecs, and a core WebHandler API comparable to the Servlet API but with non-blocking contracts.

On that foundation, Spring WebFlux provides a choice of two programming models:

* Annotated Controllers: Consistent with Spring MVC and based on the same annotations from the spring-web module. Both Spring MVC and WebFlux controllers support reactive (Reactor and RxJava) return types, and, as a result, it is not easy to tell them apart. One notable difference is that WebFlux also supports reactive @RequestBody arguments.
* Functional Endpoints: Lambda-based, lightweight, and functional programming model. You can think of this as a small library or a set of utilities that an application can use to route and handle requests. The big difference with annotated controllers is that the application is in charge of request handling from start to finish versus declaring intent through annotations and being called back.
